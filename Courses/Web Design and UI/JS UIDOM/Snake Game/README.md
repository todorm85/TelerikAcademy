##Introduction
This is a DOM-based game of Snake which was developed as a team project for the 
JS-UI&amp;DOM-2015 Course in [Telerik Academy](http://telerikacademy.com/) by the “Champagne-Cocktail” team.

##Conception of the game
The game it's based on the well known game Snake with a couple of optimization. 
Rules of the game:
You can move Doncho snake with the four arrows (if you start with the left one you will immediately die). Doncho has to eat the ninja, if he does - he is taking 10 points. Also there is a moving bonus, which is ricocheting from the walls and if the snake takes it it gives him 15 points. If the snake hit some of the faces dies.
