## Description

RoomMeasurer is an app that lets you quickly scan the floor plan of a room by taking photos of each corner. You can also calculate the real size and distance of an object based on a relevant reference in a photo. The object and reference must be at equal distance from the camera and the calculated side must be parallel to the camera plane.
